                        <p>In 1959, Bill Larson opened the first <a href="https://www.roundtablepizza.com/">Round Table
                                Pizza</a> in Menlo Park, California. He envisioned a gathering place where you could
                            “share a little pizza with someone you love.” Bill believed in using gold-standard
                            ingredients and time-honored recipes to boldly bake hand-crafted pizza worth sharing. </p>
